# authentication-api
This is an authentication api. You can directly use this in your projects.
I have added Passport Local auth for now . Soon I will add Google Oauth2.0 , Github Oauth , Facebook Oauth , Twitter Oauth. 
Feel free to contribute to the repo if you can . Thanks and please give a star⭐ if you found it helpful.


# Passport-Local
Register route is API_URL/register ( This route will also check whether the user is already registered .
If already registered it will show the msg.)

Login route is API_URL/login ( This will also check whether the user has entered a wrong email and password and give message accordingly ) 

Logout route API_URL/logout ( removes user session from the browser and logs out user ) 


# Google Oauth2.0
Coming soooooon...................
